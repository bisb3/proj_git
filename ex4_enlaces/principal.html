        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <hr/>
           <p>
            In the beginning, the story was told the real facts
            with fanciful narration, based on myths and inexplicable phenomena.
            From VI BC, some people wanted to know what was happening in
            real This movement, Logos, was dedicated to seeking and researching answers
            to natural phenomena from natural or observable facts. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Philosophy comes from the Greek root Philo- which means "love"
            and -Sophos, or "wisdom." When someone studies philosophy they want to understand how
            and why people do certain things and how to live a good life. In others
            words, they want to know the meaning of life.
           </p> 
           <h3>Philosophers</h3>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            People who study philosophy are called philosophers.
            Because philosophy is the study of everything, it has many paths like
            science (rationalism), metaphysics (justice, faith, ...),
            prism (experience), existence, etc.

            They were recognized in antiquity as the first philosophers
            and scientists of the Western tradition. The majority
            were born before Socrates. Your questions studied
            about the origin and nature of the physical world have brought them
            to call themselves cosmologists or naturalists. The Presocratics
            stated that there was only one lasting material issue:
            the origin of all things and their continuing nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            They started asking questions like where did everything come from, why is it there
               there is so much variety and how can nature be described mathematically?
           </p>
           <p>

           <p>
            Heraclitus was a philosopher who spoke of the energy of the universe.
            Having said that everything changes and nature is in constant motion, the reason
            by which everything exists is by the struggle of forces, the cosmos. not there
            there is order without disorder and there is no balance without chaos.

            They were the opposite of Heraclitus, he believed that the universe is 
            immutable, eternal and uncreated.

            <p><em>
            “We can speak and think only of what exists. And what exists is uncreated

            simple, eloquent, but still confounding series of arguments. Essentially, Zeno 
            contends that before an object can reach its target, it must first achieve the 
            halfway mark. After that, the object is obliged to traverse to the median of 
            the remaining distance. Continuing, it must then reach the next halfway mark 
            again and again and again, infinitely.

            more on morals behaviour o ethics and having a good life. If having a good life 
            means being wise, kind and having good morals which later were considered as
            foundation for Christianity.

                moral perfection. Although regarded as sexless, God has traditionally been 
                referred to by the masculine pronoun.

                deities. Less broadly, atheism is a rejection of the belief that any 
                deities exist. In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the 
                position that there are no deities. Atheism is contrasted with theism, the 
                concept that belief in the existence of deities. Normally, the movement 
                started in the 18th century after the French revolution of 1789.
